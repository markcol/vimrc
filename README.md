This is the vimrc file I use at both work and home.

To install:

	git clone git://github.com/markcol/vimrc.git ~/.vim
	sh ~/.vim/install.sh

This will link ~/.vim/[g]vimrc to ~/.[g]vimrc. NeoBundle, plugins, Go programs
and other dependencies will be downloaded or created automatically during
initial startup.
